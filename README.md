## Features

### Counter Component
- **Persistent State**: The counter value is stored in `localStorage`, ensuring the value is saved across page reloads.
- **Dynamic Background**: The background color changes dynamically based on the counter value, creating a visually engaging user experience.
- **Hover Effects**: The card containing the counter is animated with CSS hover effects, giving users visual feedback on interactions.

### User Data Form
- **Form Validation**: Ensures required fields are filled before submitting.
- **Data Persistence**: User data is stored in `localStorage`, allowing for retrieval upon page reload.
- **User Interface**: The form uses Material-UI components for a clean and professional UI design.

### Google Authentication
- **Secure Login**: Google Authentication ensures that user login is both secure and straightforward.
- **Session Management**: Once logged in, user sessions are managed automatically, allowing the user to stay signed in across different pages.

### Charts and Data Visualizations
- **Bar Chart**: Displays the time spent on the app, with real-time updates as the user interacts with the application.
- **Radar Chart**: Visualizes different user activities such as browsing, idle time, and active status in a radar chart.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The charts update in real-time as the user interacts with the app, offering valuable insights into their activity.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that improves the development experience with fast builds.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: A popular React UI framework that provides pre-designed components for rapid development.
- **Google Authentication**: Allows users to log in with their Google account.
- **localStorage**: A web storage feature used to store user data across sessions.
- **Chart.js**: A JavaScript library used for rendering charts and graphs.
- **React Hooks (useState, useEffect)**: Used to manage state and side effects in functional components.
